        <p><strong>Information collected or obtained from third parties</strong></p>
        <p>This section sets out how we obtain or collect information about you from third parties.</p>
        <p><strong>Information received from third parties</strong></p>
        <p>Generally, we do not receive information about you from third parties. </p>
        <p>It is also possible that third parties with whom we have had no prior contact may provide us with information
            about you.</p>
        <p>Information we obtain from third parties will generally be your name and contact details, but will include
            any additional information about you which they provide to us.</p>
        <p><strong>Legal basis for processing</strong>: necessary to perform a contract or to take steps at your request
            to enter into a contract (Article 6(1)(b) of the General Data Protection Regulation).<br><strong>Reason why
                necessary to perform a contract</strong>: where a third party has passed on information about you to us
            (such as your name and email address) in order for us to provide services to you, we will process your
            information in order to take steps at your request to enter into a contract with you and perform a contract
            with you (as the case may be).</p>
        <p><strong>Legal basis for processing</strong>: consent (Article 6(1)(a) of the General Data Protection
            Regulation).<br><strong>Consent</strong>: where you have asked that a third party to share information about
            you with us and the purpose of sharing that information is not related to the performance of a contract or
            services by us to you, we will process your information on the basis of your consent, which you give by
            asking the third party in question to pass on your information to us.</p>
        <p><strong>Legal basis for processing</strong>: our legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f) of the General Data
            Protection Regulation).<br><strong>Legitimate interests</strong>: where a third party has shared information
            about you with us and you have not consented to the sharing of that information, we will have a legitimate
            interest in processing that information in certain circumstances.</p>
        <p>For example, we would have a legitimate interest in processing your information to perform our obligations
            under a sub-contract with the third party, where the third party has the main contract with you. Our
            legitimate interest is the performance of our obligations under our sub-contract.</p>
        <p>Similarly, third parties may pass on information about you to us if you have infringed or potentially
            infringed any of our legal rights. In this case, we will have a legitimate interest in processing that
            information to investigate and pursue any such potential infringement.</p>
        <p><strong>Where we receive information about you in error</strong></p>
        <p>If we receive information about you from a third party in error and/or we do not have a legal basis for
            processing that information, we will delete your information.</p>
        <p><strong>Information obtained by us from third parties</strong></p>
        <p>In certain circumstances (for example, to verify the information we hold about you or obtain missing
            information we require to provide you with a service) we will obtain information about you from certain
            publicly accessible sources, both EU and non-EU, such as Companies House, business directories, media
            publications, social media, and websites (including your own website if you have one).</p>
        <p><strong>Legal basis for processing</strong>: necessary to perform a contract or to take steps at your request
            to enter into a contract (Article 6(1)(b) of the General Data Protection Regulation).<br><strong>Reason why
                necessary to perform a contract</strong>: where you have entered into a contract or requested that we
            enter into a contract with you, in certain circumstances, we will obtain information about you from public
            sources in order to enable us to understand your business and provide services to you or services to a
            sufficient standard. </p>
        <p>For example, we would obtain and/or verify your email address from your website or from a directory where you
            ask us to send you information by email if we do not possess the information or we need to confirm that we
            have recorded your email address correctly.</p>
        <p><strong>Legal basis for processing</strong>: our legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f) of the General Data
            Protection Regulation).<br><strong>Legitimate interests</strong>: in certain circumstances, we will have a
            legitimate interest in obtaining information about you from public and private sources. For example, if you
            have infringed or we suspect that you have infringed any of our legal rights, we will have a legitimate
            interest in obtaining and processing information about you from such sources in order to investigate and
            pursue any suspected or potential infringement.</p>

        <p><strong>Logic involved</strong>: by automatically analysing and categorising information such as the location

            users and getting to know our website users&rsquo; preferences so our website can better meet their needs
            and desires.</p>
        <p><u>Use of profiling in marketing emails</u></p>
        <p>We use web beacons in our marketing emails to analyse who opens our emails and what actions they take (for
            example, what they click on). We will only process information from web beacons if you have consented to
            their use in accordance with our cookies policy (<a href="https://institute.fintechcircle.com/cookies">https://institute.fintechcircle.com/cookies</a>).</p>
        <p><strong>Logic involved</strong>: By analysing how our email recipients respond to our emails, we are able to
            improve the content and effectiveness of our emails and gauge who is most interested.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance and envisaged consequences</strong>: your behaviour when you open our emails will be
            tracked using small gif files (web beacons), including open rates, and click through rates.</p>

            concerning health or information concerning a natural person&rsquo;s sex life or sexual orientation.</p>
        <p>We do not knowingly or intentionally collect sensitive personal information from individuals, and you must
            not submit sensitive personal information to us.</p>
        <p>If, however, you inadvertently or intentionally transmit sensitive personal information to us, you will be
            considered to have explicitly consented to us processing that sensitive personal information under Article
            9(2)(a) of the General Data Protection Regulation. We will use and process your sensitive personal
            information for the purposes of deleting it.</p>
        <p><strong>Changes to our Privacy Policy</strong></p>
        <p>We update and amend our Privacy Policy from time to time.</p>
        <p><u>Minor changes to our Privacy Policy</u></p>
        <p>Where we make minor changes to our Privacy Policy, we will update our Privacy Policy with a new effective
            date stated at the beginning of it. Our processing of your information will be governed by the practices set
            out in that new version of the Privacy Policy from its effective date onwards.</p>
        <p><u>Major changes to our Privacy Policy or the purposes for which we process your information</u></p>
        <p>Where we make major changes to our Privacy Policy or intend to use your information for a new purpose or a
            different purpose than the purposes for which we originally collected it, we will notify you by email (where
            possible) or by posting a notice on our website. </p>
        <p>We will provide you with the information about the change in question and the purpose and any other relevant
            information before we use your information for that new purpose.</p>
        <p>Wherever required, we will obtain your prior consent before using your information for a purpose that is
            different from the purposes for which we originally collected it.</p>
        <p><strong>Children&rsquo;s Privacy</strong></p>
        <p>Because we care about the safety and privacy of children online, we comply with the Children&rsquo;s Online
            Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). COPPA and its accompanying regulations protect the privacy of
            children using the internet. We do not knowingly contact or collect information from persons under the age
            of 18. The website is not intended to solicit information of any kind from persons under the age of 18.</p>
        <p>It is possible that we could receive information pertaining to persons under the age of 18 by the fraud or
            deception of a third party. If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will, where
            required by law to do so, immediately obtain the appropriate parental consent to use that information or, if
            we are unable to obtain such parental consent, we will delete the information from our servers. If you would
            like to notify us of our receipt of information about persons under the age of 18, please do so by sending
            an email to info@fintechcircle.com.</p>
